To make sure that all implemented features will be considered in the final assessment, students should illustrate the capabilities of their application in a short product video.
Follow the instructions below when preparing the product video.


### Duration & Delivery

- The videos must be 9-10 minutes long, this is a strict requirement.
- You must not slow-down/speed-up the spoken parts of the videos, just to make them fit.
- Use a standard format that can be played on Windows/macOS without installing additional codecs. Tools like [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/) can transcode videos into efficient codecs like H.264 or H.265.
- The maximum file size is 500MB.
- Upload your recording in the corresponding Brightspace assignment. Take into account that uploading a video may take some time.
- We do not expect professionally edited videos, form follows function.


### Presenters

- The entire team must appear in the video.
- We won't stop the time, but we expect (roughly) equal contributions from everybody.
- The video should contain spoken instructions and show both your content (e.g., slides/app demo/...) and the speakers.
- There is no required layout/style for the video/content.


### Audience and Goal

The video presents the project results to the OOPP staff.
It should showcase the final product and highlight features that the application unique.
As a metaphor, imagine you would create a product video for an app store that tells potential users what to expect from your app.


### Recommended Outline

You are free to structure your presentation as you see fit, but we would recommend you to adopt the following structure to make sure that you focus on the right things:

- Brief introduction (ca. 30s)
- Main block: What is the state of your application? (ca. 8min)
    - Focus on the user perspective. Do not show code, but implemented features in action. Also, a working application is more interesting than just slides.
    - Which features are realized in the UI? How is the interaction flow?
    - Review the [product grading schema]({%link grading/product.md%}) to understand which categories will be assessed. Show the features that make your application unique (or go beyond the requirements)
    - If you have cool, but non-visible features, such as an advanced polling mechanism or a new protocol for the data exchange, please include this in the presentation as well.
- How would you extend the application, technically or content-wise (ca. 1min)
- Wrap-up (ca. 30s)

Please note that the timing information for the different sections is not a hard requirement and just meant as a rough guideline for where to put the focus.

### Submission

Please upload the final video to the corresponding assignment on Brightspace.
You can upload multiple times, older uploads always get replaced by the latest version.

You can use the same Brightspace assignment to share your draft with your TA (and replace this upload later, once you have the final video).
The form of the draft is up to the team, some teams prefer to share a storyboard, others already have a rough cut of their videos.
The more information is provided to the TA, the better the feedback can be.
