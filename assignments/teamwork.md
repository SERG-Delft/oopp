# {{ page.title }}

The teamwork lecture introduces several assignments that need to be executed continuously throughout the whole duration of the project.
Please study the corresponding [grading criteria]({{site.baseurl}}/grading/process#teamwork).

## Prepare and Run a Meeting

Each team will have a mandatory, supervised meeting with their TA during each lab session.
This meeting should not happen accidentally, instead we would like that the team practices how to make the most efficient use of everybody's time.

The actual assignment consists of several taks:

1. The meeting chair has to make an agenda for the meeting, we provide an [agenda template][agenda] that should be used for that.
This agenda should be committed to your team repository (`/docs/meetings/week-01.docx`) before the lab.
2. During your meeting, two students will fill the roles of the [chair][role-chair] and the [minute taker][role-minute-taker].
Study the linked documents, which recap from the lecture what these roles entail.
3. The minute taker will add comments and notes to the agends during the meeting.
Make sure that the updated agenda file is then committed ot the repository again.

{: .caution}
At the end of the project, every team member must have taken both roles (chair/minute taker) at least once.
We recommend that you rotate these roles within the team right from the start.

## Code of Conduct

Every team is different and it is important that it has an in-depth conversation about how it wants to work.
There are various topics that this conversation should include, like what are the shared values or which goal is actually being pursued.
The result is then documented in a *Code of Conduct*.

In the OOPP, we want you to create a Code of Conduct for your team as well.
This will give you insights into what you expect from each other and it documents the agreements you make as a team.
To help you with this important step, we have provided a [Template for a Code of Conduct][teamwork-coc], which covers various topics that we think you should have a discussion about.

For the assignment, fill out the various sections and commit your *Code of Conduct* to your team repository (`/docs/code-of-conduct.docx`).
This document is flexible, you can add sections that you find important in your team or remove sections that you think do not apply. 
Also note that the Code of Conduct can change over time.
When you manage to overcome a conflict in your team or learn something throughout the project, feel free to extend the document.

## Providing Feedback

In a team, it is important that the different members provide each other feedback to generate an opportunity for individual, personal growth.
In the OOPP project, this feedback takes two forms.

1. At two defined moments in the schedule, all students have to give each other feedback via Buddycheck (available through Brightspace).
2. On a more technical level, all students are supposed to review each others source code.
The goal here is not just to improve the code, these reviews also serve as a learning opportunity and the same feedback rules apply.

## Self Reflection

We will determine whether the learning objectives of the teamwork module have been reached through a self-reflection of each individual student.

#### What is a reflection?

The ability to reflect on ones own actions is an important competency.
It is about looking back at your own experiences in order to learn from them.
Reflecting means that you hold a mirror up to yourself to reflect on how you work, for example, what choices you make within that, what skills you use and how that feels. 

When reflecting, you examine the way you act, but also how you react to a certain situation and how that *feels*.
Your feelings are a theme that you should dwell on extensively in your way of reflecting.
Often, we react to a situation on the first impulse: you do not think before you act but act on the basis of your own emotions.
You may also be working from preconceived viewpoints or beliefs without realizing it yourself.

By reflecting 

- You increase your self-knowledge. 
- You are aware of the emotions that play a role in certain situations. 
- You gain insight into how you act upon them.

Reflecting is therefore about looking back and asking yourself questions about how you are at studying (or work) and what the backgrounds are.
Reflecting is not so much about whether you did the work well or not, that is evaluation.
It is important to postpone evaluating your own actions.
This leaves room for self-examination, which allows you to learn more about your own actions.
Self-reflection can prevent you from running into the same problems over and over again.
So, when you move into a next context, say your next project, it helps when you know about salient aspects of yourself and the interdependence with your context.

#### Assignment

In this assignment, you will write a self-reflection about *three specific situations* that occurred during the project in which you focus on your behavior, learning process and experiences.
Pay attention to what went well and what could be improved. 

For *each situation*, reflect on the following aspects:

- *Situation:* Describe the context or situation. Where was it? Who was involved?
- *Task:* Describe your role or task.
- *Action:* Examine your behavior. What did you do and why? What were your thoughts?
- *Result* Describe the result of your actions. What did you learn? What was your (least) favorite part? How did others react?
- *Reflection:* Reflect on the situation. How did you experience your tasks? Are you satisfied with your achieved results? 
- *Advice:* Give yourself a piece of advice. What would you do differently next time and what tools would you use for that? 

Your self-reflection has to comply with several formal requirements:

- Refer to the contents and the theory of the teamwork lecture.
- Incorporate the feedback you have received from your team members.
- Follow the ACM formatting template ([GitHub](https://github.com/proksch/template-report), [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zsdrgrzgncnb)), no change in the formatting is allowed.
- The reflection must have 1,500-1,800 words, this should roughly represent two pages.

Submit your reflection on Brightspace in the corresponding *Assignment*.
You can submit the draft and, later in the course, the final version to the same *Assignment*.
You are allowed to submit multiple times, each submission will replace the previous one.

Your TA is the first point of contact for any question about the self reflection.
