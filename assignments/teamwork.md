## Code of Conduct

TODO

In this assignment, students must make a Code of Conduct with their projectteam. This gives insight into what you expect from each other and documents the agreements they make on that as a team.
For this group assignment, they can use the template, made available by ITAV. This is a template, which means that it is allowed to add or remove questions if it is not applicable to the team. Also, the Code of Conduct is a flexible document: it can change over time.
