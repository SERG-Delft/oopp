# {{ page.title }}

Unfortunately, the experience of past years has shown that several students will face a removal from the course due to either missing the deadline of an assignment or due to failing one.

Should this happen for the first time, we will usually be lenient and allow the student to remain in the course, under two conditions:

1. The original assignment is completed/repaired after granting an extension.
2. The student writes an essay for this repair assignment.

The course staff will decide all incidents on a case-by-case basis.
Should the decision be leniency, students are allowed to repair their assignment and submit the essay.
Concrete requirements and deadlines will be directly communicated to the student.

In case this repair affects a team assignment, we expect an essay from every team member.

## Format

If a repair essay is requested from a student, you will receive concrete instructions from the course organizers.
Your essay should reflect on the situation.
Take inspiration from the following questions:

- How could this situation happen?
- What do you change to avoid missing a deadline or failing other assignments in the future?
- How did the failed assignment affect you and your team members? Relate your answer to reaching the learning objective or working on the project or improving the teamwork skills or ...

Feel free to adjust the questions to your concrete situation, while keeping the spirit of the original questions.

The document must follow the ACM formatting template ([GitHub](https://github.com/proksch/template-report), [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zsdrgrzgncnb)), no change in the formatting is allowed (font size, line height, margins, etc.).
You are free however, to structure the document as you see fit.
The created essay must contain at least 700 words, which should roughly translate to one page in the given format.

{:.caution}
The intent of the guidelines is to create comparable results.
We will check the formatting guidelines strictly and fail repairs that ignore them.

## Submission

The essay is to be submitted in the corresponding assignment on Brightspace.
The relevant deadlines for the assignment extension and the repair essay will be directly communicated to the student in the notification about the repair assignment.
