# {{ page.title }}

Unfortunately, the experience of past years has shown that several students will face a removal from the course due to missing the deadline of an assignment.

Should this happen for the first time, we will usually be lenient and allow the student to remain in the course, under two conditions: 1) the required assignment is completed after granting an extension and 2) the student completes a repair assignment.

The course staff will decide all incidents on a case-by-case basis.
Should the decision be leniency, students are allowed to submit the repair assignment.
Concrete requirements and deadlines will be directly communicated to the student.

## Format

If a repair assignment is being requested from the students, it is required to write an essay that reflects on the following questions:

- How could this situation happen?
- What do you change to avoid missing deadline in the future?
- How did missing the deadline affect the ability of you and your team members to follow the course?

The document must follow the ACM formatting template ([GitHub](https://github.com/proksch/template-report), [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zsdrgrzgncnb)), no change in the formatting is allowed.
The created essay must contain at least 700 words, which should roughly translate to one page in the given format.

## Submission

The essay is to be submitted in the corresponding assignment on Brightspace.
The relevant deadlines for the extended assignment and the repair assignment will be communicated to the student.
