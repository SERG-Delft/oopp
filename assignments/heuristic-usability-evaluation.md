# {{ page.title }}

Describe how you apply Nielsen's usability heuristics to evaluate and improve the prototype of your application UI.
The report should make it clear from which prototype you start, how you evaluate it, and what improvements you made/will make based on the obtained results.

## Prototyping

To do a heuristic evaluation, you first need to have a prototype.
A prototype is any sort of ‘test’ version of your final product: in your case software.
A prototype doesn’t have to be functional, in the case of software development, there doesn’t even need to be much coding involved at all.
(Given the timeline of the course, it probably will not be).
For this assignment, your prototype will be of the GUI, which means the design is the first important step.
For this reason, we advise you to create paper/digital image prototypes of your GUI, so that you can evaluate these before you fully implement them.
This way you can actually incorporate the findings in your final project!

For your prototype, you have a number of options.
You can for instance create a series of individual screenshots, a slide show, or a video that shows a simulated use of the system.
Make sure that your material allows the evaluator to truly *explore* your GUI design, so always incorporate more than just one screen.
You should also include the *transitions*, so evaluators can understand what happens when a button is clicked, what is shown, or what the next screen is.

You can use various tools for your prototype: pen&paper sketches (scan them), Powerpoint designs, or free online prototyping tools (such as [Moqups](https://moqups.com/)).
The more sophisticated the prototype, the more informative the evaluation can generate.
However, please note that the focus is the evaluation.
More advanced prototypes will not necessarily result in a better grade if the evaluation is worse.

## Evaluation & Report

Evaluate your prototype with students from other OOP teams (ask your TA for a partner team), the students will be your HE evaluators.
You are responsible for organize the evaluation and collect, analyze, and report the results.

The report must follow the ACM formatting template ([GitHub](https://github.com/proksch/template-report), [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zsdrgrzgncnb)), no change in the formatting is allowed.
The report essay must have 2,200-2,500 words and it must follow the following structure:


#### Introduction

- Briefly describe the objective of your evaluation.
- Describe/show the prototype you are evaluating.

#### Methods

- *Experts:* How many experts did you recruit? What is their level of expertise?
- *Procedure:* Describe, in detail, what experts needed to do. Someone reading this section should be able to replicate what they did. This should include:
    - How are you instructing experts on what to do?
    - What are the experts seeing? A prototype, application, design?
    - What do they need to do step by step?
    - What heuristics are they using?
- *Measures (Data collection):* What are you measuring? Describe what the experts need to report, and how you record this. Someone reading this section should know the format of your raw results.

#### Results

- What are your results? Report on your findings.
- If you make any adjustments (averages, etc.) report what you have done! You will probably not be able to just show all your raw results, so let the reader know how you got from the raw results to what you are reporting.
- If you prioritize the list of problems (for instance with the matrix used in the lecture), show how you have prioritized your problems.


#### Conclusions & Improvements

- What are your main conclusions from these results?
- This section should lead from the Results into the Improvements.
- Describe how you will improve our application based on your results. What changes will you make, and why? What would it look like before and after? Why is the improved version better? Motivate your choices using the heuristics and your results.
- The conclusion of this section should show your final GUI design.
- Note that this report is only about the design, so it is not necessary to already show the finished improved implementation.


## Submission

Commit the report (draft and final) to the team repository.
Your TA is the first point of contact for any question about the heuristic usability evaluation or the report.
