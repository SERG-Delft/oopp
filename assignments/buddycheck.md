Provide [peer feedback][buddycheck] to your team members.
Please follow the feedback guidelines of the teamwork module and fill *all parts* of the survey honestly.

For each member, use the AID model to give a TIP (something that can be improved) and elaborate on a concrete TOP (something that is good) that you illustrate through stating observable facts.
Make sure that your feedback is constructive and that it has a reasonable length, is understandable, and is concrete.
Avoid high-level feedback that does not refer back to concrete examples or feedback without context that is so short that the recipient cannot understand it.
Remember that *"Constructive participation in all peer reviews"* is a pass/fail element of the course.

Make sure that you practice the feedback principles that have been taught in the Teamwork module. It might be worthwhile to study the corresponding section on *feedback* in the Teamwork reader once more.

*Note:* Your feedback will be anonymous. The answers to the "open questions" are only visible to course staff (TAs + lecturers). The "peer messages" (tips/tops) are visible (anonymously) to the respective peer.

*Note:* Answers to the two questions on *Individual Performance* will be used to derive the individual adjustments of the [Product Grade]({%link grading/product.md%}#individual-adjustment) and [Process Grade]({%link grading/process.md%}#individual-adjustment).
