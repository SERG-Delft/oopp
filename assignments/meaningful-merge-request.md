# {{ page.title }}


We expect all students to start contributing to the project as early as possible in the course.
A *contribution* does not have to be a full-blown feature of any sort, but we expect even early in the project that teams already start with adapting the template, playing with technology, adding proof-of-concept implementations, or creating their first scenes and endpoints.

What we want to see from each student are technical contributions, i.e., logic in Java files.
The changes should not be trivial and it is not enough to, for example, change comments, add meeting notes, or extend JavaFX files.
Implement the changes on a feature branch and open a merge request to get the features merged into main.
It does not matter who closes the MR, but the corresponding student must be the one who had opened the MR.

This assignment is due several weeks into the course.
At this point, we expect that everybody has contributed to the project multiple times already and this assignment should present zero extra effort for anybody.
The main purpose is to create a checkpoint, which allows us to protect teams from low-performers who are not participating in a constant and constructive manner.

{: .caution}
If you are struggling with the completion of this assignment, please contact your TA as soon as possible.
Your contributions are substantially below expectations and you must start catching up.
