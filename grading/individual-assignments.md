| .gitignore | No meaningless files committed, repository should contain a `.gitignore` file. |
| History | The Git history (roughly) reflects the screenshot from the assignment and contains several forks/merges from main that represent the different feature branches in the history, most importantly, there should be a merge commit, which solves the conflict. |
