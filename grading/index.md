# Grading

This course provides *formative feedback* throughout the course and defines *pass/fail criteria* and *graded components* for the summative assessment.


## Formative Feedback

Throughout the course, you will receive formative feedback from your TAs using the same rubrics that will be used for the final, summative assessment.
Each week has certain focus points that are usually focussing on recent assignments.
The feedback will be available before each week's TA meeting, so check in with your TA, should you have clarification questions.

The rubrics will be scored on a basic scale:

- **Insufficient:** Below the required level. This must be addressed as soon as possible and should improve significantly.
- **Sufficient:** Right around the required level, pay attention not to slip into an insufficient.
- **Good:** A solid level that shows that the assignment goals have been well met.
- **Very Good:** A good submission, which exceeds the expectations in some aspects.
- **Excellent:** Great submission that overall exceeds the expectations. Well done!

The goal of the formative feedback is to warn you in time about aspects of your project that are below the expected level.
Formative feedback does not influence the grade, the goal is to inform you about your study progress and to help you understand how we will assess your efforts in the end.
Please note that not improving an insufficient rating until the course ends will be reflected in your grade, or it might even affect your ability to pass the course.


## Pass/Fail criteria

The course defines pass/fail criteria to ensure that students can follow the teamwork phase by checking whether necessary skills have been acquired in the first weeks.
Also, the criteria protect teams from unmotivated students that try to capitalize on the work of others.

{: .caution}
Each student needs to pass *all* criteria or they will fail the course, regardless of their overall performance in the other areas of the project.


- Upholding a professional attitude when interacting with peers and staff.
- Attending all tutor meetings (Absence will only be excused on a case-by-case basis, when a valid reason has been indicated before(!) missing a meeting)
- Completing all *individual* assignments
    - Passing the Git assignment
    - Having an accepted merge request of reasonable size
    - Constructive participation in all peer reviews
- Actively participating in the team process
    - Visibly contributing to the project throughout all weeks of the project (i.e. commits and merge-request activity)
    - Contributing a substantial (source-code) feature to the final product
    - Contributing to all team deadlines and deliverables
    - Receiving a positive evaluation in final peer review
- Ability to explain lecture contents and defend all aspects of the team project in the oral examination

{: .caution}
Several of these criteria will be assessed by investigating GitLab activity.
It is the responsibility of each student to make sure that their activity becomes visible through creating *commits* and *branches*, interacting with *issues*, and participating in *merge requests*.


## Graded components

The grading of our course is based on the following aspects:

- [Process][rubric-process] (40%): Teamwork aspects of the project and how well you worked together.
- [Product][rubric-product] (40%): The developed application and the technology used.
- [Heuristic Usability Evaluation][rubric-hci] (15%): Results and report of heuristic usability evaluation.
- [Product Pitch][rubric-pitch] & Oral Examination (5%): Illustrating the features of the created application and checking individually, whether the learning objectives of the course have been reached.

Please study the subpages to understand the concrete requirements.

*Please note:* The oral examination is a pass/fail decision and does not influence the grade.
It serves as a measure for fraud prevention and will be used to check individually whether LOs have been reached by asking questions about lecture contents and aspects of the team application.
Students that are unable to answer these questions will fail the course, as defined in the individual pass/fail criteria.
