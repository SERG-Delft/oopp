The following rubrics contribute to the process grade.

## Backlog

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Structure | The backlog follows the expected document structure, contains a good level of detail, and is written in a clear fashion. |
| Epics | The different application features have been identified and proritized. Epics are properly introduced to clarify the features and their scopes. |
| User Stories | User stories have consistent format and convey the who/what/why. They focus on the user perspective and cover all requested features. |
| Acceptance Criteria | User stories are either small and have a clear effect, or explicit acceptance criteria are used for clarification. Stories/criteria describe a measurable/observable way to decide when they are done/finished. |



## Planning and Task Distribution in GitLab

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Task Identification | User stories have been translated into actionable development tasks. |
| Tasks Granularity | High-level features are broken down into small, manageable pieces that can be finished by a single developer in one day. Tasks are well-defined and have a clear description of the expected outcome and when they're considered done.                                                                |
| Task Estimations | Tasks have an estimate, which is established in a team process (e.g., planning poker). Estimates of the upcoming tasks are being updated every week. |
| Task Planning | The team uses issues and milestones to plan their future activities. Relevant events (unforeseen problems, updated estimates, ...) are taken into consideration and the overall task planning of all remaining tasks is regularly updated, for example, as preparation for the weekly TA meeting. |
| Tasks Distribution | Tasks get equally distributed among the team members. |
| Task Completion | Tasks actually get done. |


 
## Teamwork

In contrast to the [individual pass/fail criteria that are listed in the grading overview]({{site.baseurl}}/grading/#passfail-criteria), the teamwork module presents a pass/fail element for the whole group.
To pass this aspect of the course, the team needs to continuously execute the [teamwork assignments]({{site.baseurl}}/assignments/teamwork).

The team will receive formative feedback on these assignments from a TA.
It is required to reach at least a *Sufficient* rating in the end.
Should a team receive an *Insufficient* rating in their weekly rubrics, it is required that the team shows willingness and initiative for improvement.

The summative assessment of this part is based on a self-reflection of each *each student*:

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Formalities | Follows the formatting guidelines (ACM format, length, structure) |
| Depth | The experience that has been picked as an example is suited for the reflection. The reflection has a good depth in all parts. |
| Reflection on Existing Knowledge | The reflection discusses existing knowledge, questions, or assumptions. The reflection contains an articulation of a new understanding that results from the experience. |
| Connection to Academic Concepts | The reflection draws connections between the experience and the concepts/theories that have been discussed in class. It is decribed how the theory was applied in practice. |
| Evidence of Development | The reflection articulates a personal development. It elaborate on the transformation of a personal perspective or on a new insight that will affect future team work. |



## Code Contribution and Code Reviews

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Focused commits | Commits only affect a small number of files and aggregate a coherent change to the system. Commit messages clearly summarize the change.|
| Isolation | The group has used feature branches or merge requests to isolate individual features during development. |
| Reviewability | Merge requests are easy to review. For example: they contain a low number of formatting changes; they limit the number of commits; the branch was recently created and des not deviate too much from `main`; changes are coherent and relate to each other; ... |
| Code reviews | Reviews are timely, constructive, and lead to iterative improvements. |
| Build Server | Build Server was important part of the development process. Team has committed frequently. Failing builds were fixed directly. Team has selected Checkstyle rules. |



## Individual Adjustment

We will analyze the second peer-feedback assignment of all teams (Buddycheck) with respect to contributions to the *process* rubrics.
Should an individual stick out from their team performance, we will sightly adjust the *process* grade of this student by -0.5 to +0.5.

*Please note:* This only affects the partial grade and is not an adjustment of the overall OOPP grade.
