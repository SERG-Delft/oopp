| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Methods: Reporting | The report clearly describes the prototype and the methodology, so the evaluation could be repeated by someone else. |
| Methods: Execution | The execution of the evaluation is well documented and the chosen procedure follows the guidelines provided in the lecture. |
| Results, Analysis & Conclusion | The report lists the identified problems individually and links the corresponding heuristic to it. The problems are analyzed and a thorough conclusion is formulated that is based on the obtained results. |
| Improvements | Does the evaluation clearly describe the changes (relating to results/heuristics) and prioritize the improvements? Are the changes appropriate for each problem given the heuristic? Does the report give a good overview of the final GUI?|
