### Week 4

A lecture on *Heuristic Usability Evaluation* will be provided by guest lectures from the *Interactive Intelligence* section, [dr. Myrthe Tielman](http://ii.tudelft.nl/~myrthe/) and [dr.ir. Willem-Paul Brinkman](https://ii.tudelft.nl/willem-paul/index.php/node/1).
In the lecture, you will conduct a heuristic evaluation and compare your results with experts.

- Videos: [History][hue-history], [Evaluators][hue-evaluators], [Reporting][hue-reporting], [Heuristics][hue-heuristics], [Procedure][hue-procedure], [Video Slides][hue-video-slides]
- Paper: [Nielsen et al. - How to Conduct a Heuristic Evaluation][hue-paper]
- Results (do not look at before lecture):
    - [Problems found by experts][hue-problems]
    - [Prioritized problems found by experts][hue-problems-expert]

{: .caution}
Come prepared to the lecture! Watch the videos and read the paper to make sure that you can participate in the heuristic evaluation.
