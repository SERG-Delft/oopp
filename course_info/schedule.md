## {{ page.title }}

The course starts with several *lectures* that provide you with the required background knowledge.
In week 1, you will also meet your *team-members* and you start making a plan for the project.
Throughout the course you'll be supervised by a TA that is assigned to your team for the entire project. 
You will see your TA during the *weekly lab meetings* that are organized during the labs and where you will demonstrate your progress and you discuss feedback and/or questions you may have.

In the following, you will find the schedule for the *lectures*, more information about the *lab* organization, especially for week 1, and all relevant assignments.
Make sure that you keep an eye on all relevant dates and deadlines.

{: .caution}
Valid reasons for an absence need to be approved by the course staff *before* missing a meeting.
Missing a lab without excuse will lead to the removal from the group.

You can find your team number on Brightspace, when you click on *Collaboration Â» Groups*.
The table on that list also includes an email symbol, you can contact your team members through this link, if you want to get in contact with everybody in the first week.

Once you know your team number, you can check the [staff page]({{site.baseurl}}/course_info/staff/) to find your TA.
In week 1, every team will have a 45min slot with their TA, you can find your concrete timeslot in the [overview]({{site.baseurl}}/course_info/schedule/ta_slots/).

{: .caution}
This timeslot is only valid in week 1 to make sure that everybody knows *when* to show up *where*.
Your TA will let you know when you will meet in week 2 and onwards.
