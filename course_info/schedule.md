The course starts with several *lectures* that provide you with the required background knowledge.
In week 1, you will also meet your *team-members* and you start making a plan for the project.
Throughout the course you'll be supervised by a TA that is assigned to your team for the entire project. 
You will see your TA during the *weekly lab meetings* that are organized during the labs and where you will demonstrate your progress and you discuss feedback and/or questions you may have.

In the following, you will find the schedule for the *lectures*, more information about the *lab* organization, especially for week 1, and all relevant assignments.
Make sure that you keep an eye on all relevant dates and deadlines.

The session is not only a chance for the teams to work together for an extended period of time, it also includes a *mandatory* meeting with your TA.

Each student has one *joker*, which can be used for missing exactly one TA meeting without a valid excuse.
If you have a valid reason for absence, you will keep your joker.

Reasons for absence need to be approved by the course staff *before* missing a meeting.
Missing a TA meeting *without valid reason* and *no joker left* will lead to the removal from the group.

The teams will be formed in the first week.

This table also includes an email symbol, which allows to can contact all your team members.
With your team number, you can find your TA on the [staff page]({{site.baseurl}}/course_info/staff/).
