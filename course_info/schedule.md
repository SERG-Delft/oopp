## {{ page.title }}

The course starts with several *lectures* that provide you with the required background knowledge.
In week 1, you will also meet your *team-members* and you start making a plan for the project.
Throughout the course you'll be supervised by a TA that is assigned to your team for the entire project. 
You will see your TA during the *weekly lab meetings* that are organized during the labs and where you will demonstrate your progress and you discuss feedback and/or questions you may have.

In the following, you will find the schedule for the *lectures*, more information about the *lab* organization, especially for week 1, and all relevant assignments.
Make sure that you keep an eye on all relevant dates and deadlines.

### Lectures

We have two recurring lecture slots, Mondays, at 3:45pm, and Wednesday, at 10:45am.
All lectures will take place in Lecture Hall A in the new [Echo building](https://map.tudelftcampus.nl/poi/echo/).

### Labs

Students will participate in a weekly lab session.
The lab is scheduled every Tuesday from 1:45-5:45pm in [Drebbelweg](https://spacefinder.tudelft.nl/nl/gebouwen/35-dw/)
The session is not only a chance for the teams to work together for an extended period of time, it also includes a *mandatory* meeting with your TA.

Each student has one *joker*, which can be used for missing exactly one TA meeting without a valid excuse.
If you have a valid reason for absence, you will keep your joker.

{: .caution}
Reasons for absence need to be approved by the course staff *before* missing a meeting.
Missing a TA meeting *without valid reason* and *no joker left* will lead to the removal from the group.

The teams will be formed in the first week.
You can find your team number on Brightspace, when you click on *Collaboration » Groups*.
This table also includes an email symbol, which allows to can contact all your team members.
With your team number, you can find your TA on the [staff page]({{site.baseurl}}/course_info/staff/).
Your TA will let you know where and when you will meet during week 2+.

{: .caution}
You will already meet your TA in week 1, according to the [week 1 meeting slots]({{site.baseurl}}/course_info/schedule/ta_slots/).
This timeslot is only valid in week 1 though to make sure that everybody knows *when* to show up *where*.


### Assignment Deadlines

A large part of the course is self-study and teamwork that includes several assignments, which are all *due at 11:59pm* (NL time).
These are hard deadlines and *late submissions are not accepted*.
Missed deadlines will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
