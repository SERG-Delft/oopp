# Course Info

Welcome to the course website for the OOP Project (CSE1105), good that you are here!

Modern software development is not just about knowing the right programming language or the right technology stack. It is as important to know how to work together in a team to get a serious programming project done.

In this course, you will learn how to collaboratively create a complex software system with a focus on five learning objectives:

1. Act professionally in a team of software developers
2. Manage a complex software project in a group
3. Follow a collaborative software engineering process
4. Create a distributed application from a provided set of project requirements
5. Evaluate the design of a user interface with a heuristic usability evaluation

The first weeks of the course will focus on lectures and some self-study assignments to get you and your team started with the project.
Afterwards, the course will transition into the implementation phase, in which you will work on the project.
Overall, following this course will require you to...

- Follow interactive lectures and pre-recorded material for self-study
- Participate in a collaborative programming project in a small team
- Assess the work of yourself and others through peer reviews
- Actively participate in tutor sessions
- Run a usability evaluation and document it in a report
- Pitch your project results in a short video

This website is the central information hub for the OOP project.
You will find all required information about organization, assingments, or the assessment here, as well as link to the material and required resources.
We recommend all students to carefully study the contents of this page to avoid any negative surprises throught the project.

We are excited to run this new iteration of the OOP project and we hope you are too. The whole team is excited to meet you in person and we wish you all the best for your project!
